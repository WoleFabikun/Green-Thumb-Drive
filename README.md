# Green Thumb Guide

Green Thumb Guide is a full-stack application designed to help plant enthusiasts access personalized plant care advice and video recommendations. By leveraging cutting-edge technologies such as Next.js, TypeScript, Flask, VideoDB, VideoDBRetriever, and a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline with LlamaIndex, the application provides a seamless user experience and delivers accurate, tailored information to users.

This project serves as a proof of concept for adapting RAG models to video content. With this repository and your own VideoDB API key, you can upload any videos of your choice and create your own personalized video retrieving bot. The application demonstrates how RAG models can be effectively utilized to retrieve and present relevant video content based on user queries, enhancing the overall user experience.
